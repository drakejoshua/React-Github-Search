# React-Github-Search

A sample web project that i'm using to practice how to use React by building a simple github user search app
and sharpen react usage on tools like react lifecycle methods( for class components )
google fonts, material symbols, prop-types and tailwindCSS.

This is a simple react webapp( built using vite, react, github users API google fonts, material symbols, prop-types and tailwindCSS. ). 
This project is just to illustrate my usage and to also learn preliminary parts of react( such as: class components, states, etc ). 
It's a complete beginner project and posses no advance level code just plain react and usage of simple external framworks.
